Project Description
We set out to create a censorship-free platform for artists and creators of all types to connect with their fanbase and generate income. Creators can sign up for an account and offer subscription-based access to their fans. Fans with active subscriptions can see exclusive posts and media while supporting their favorite creators. With the recent increase in bans on Patreon creators deserve a platform for expression without censorship.
